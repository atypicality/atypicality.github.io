## Background
Our web application intends to **spread awareness** and 
**update people** about the RPI 8th Wonder Dance Group 
and its performances. Our website application will 
be **different** from other applications, as despite being 
one of, if not the *largest dance group at RPI*, Eighth Wonder
has **no currently updated website**. By creating the website, 
our group hopes to **brand the club online** in other spaces. 
Since not all students have access to *Instagram*, but all 
students **must have a computer** on it would make sense to make
a web application to help students learn about this club.
